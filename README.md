# crossy-road
Replicating the video game crossy road in Python.
I could do this in turtle graphics or shell, I will probably start with shell.
# How it could be done
I could set up a bunch of lanes, and then have randomized objects with randomized positions, which would update every second
I could follow the template of grocery store game
However, there would need to be 35+ objects moving on the screen, which may cause slowness, spotty animation, and excessive blinking
