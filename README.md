# crossy-road
- Replicating the video game crossy road in Python.
- I could do this in turtle graphics or shell, I will probably start with shell.
# How it could be done
- I could set up a bunch of lanes, and then have randomized objects with randomized positions, which would update every second
- I could follow the template of grocery store game
- However, there would need to be 35+ objects moving on the screen, which may cause slowness, spotty animation, and excessive blinking
# What's done so far
- So far, in the code in the repository, there are lanes, with two objects moving so far.
- I have made a function called printlanes, which prints the lanes and the content.
- I have also made a function called refreshlanecontent
