# crossy-road
- Replicating the video game crossy road in Python.
- I could do this in turtle graphics or shell, I will probably start with shell.
# How it could be done
- I could set up a bunch of lanes, and then have randomized objects with randomized positions, which would update every second
- I could follow the template of grocery store game
- However, there would need to be 35+ objects moving on the screen, which may cause slowness, spotty animation, and excessive blinking
# Crossy Road
- Version of crossy road with only one level, when the user gets to the end of the display he will come back to the start of the display.
# Crossy Road experimental
- Experimental version of crossy road
- The lanes will move towards the user when he moves
- game has 5 levels which change the speed and frequency of obstacles
- high score board is now done, with text file storage using shelve
  - however, score board is not formatted very well
